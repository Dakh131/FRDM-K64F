This is an Virtual COM example that demonstrates Communication Device Class (CDC)
Abstract Control Model (ACM) on USB Device.

It demonstrates a bridge between USB Virtual COM Port and UART port on the
evaluation board.

Board:                  Keil 'FRDMK64F'
Microcontroller:        NXP   'MK64FN1M0VLL12'
Clock Settings:         XTAL   = 50 MHz
                        CPUCLK = 120 MHz
                        USBCLK = 48 MHz
Bridge functionality:   Non

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "FRDMK64F USB VCOM Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different
"x" displayed in the device manager. The USB Host driver assigns "x"
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration in the system.

Testing the USB Virtual COM Port:

  Connect USB Host PC with USB cable to USB connector on the embedded board.
  
  Open Serial Terminal applications in Windows:
    -  one with "FRDMK64F USB VCOM Port(COMx)"
   
  Data sent from application to Serial Terminal.

The program is available for target(s):

 

Note : Digitally signing of the driver catalog file is required to install
drivers on 64-bit PCs using Windows Vista or later Windows versions. Please
refer to Microsoft documentation for further information.
